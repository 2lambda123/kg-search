The model is described in Brudfors et al [2020], and it builds on a number of previous works. Its objective is to achieve diffeomorphic alignment of a wide variaty of medical image modalities into a common anatomical space. This involves the ability to construct a \"tissue probability template\" from a population of scans through group-wise alignment [Ashburner & Friston, 2009; Blaiotta et al, 2018]. Diffeomorphic deformations are computed within a geodesic shooting framework [Ashburner & Friston, 2011], which is optimised with a Gauss-Newton strategy that uses a multi-grid approach to solve the system of linear equations [Ashburner, 2007]. Variability among image contrasts is modelled using a much more sophisticated version of the Gaussian mixture model with bias correction framework originally proposed by Ashburner & Friston [2005], and which has been extended to account for known variability of the intensity distributions of different tissues [Blaiotta et al, 2018]. This model has been shown to provide a good model of the intensity distributions of different imaging modalities [Brudfors et al, 2019].",

Using Finite Element and Finite Volume methods on hybrid, adaptive, unstructured multigrid hierarchies, UG4 allows for the simulation of complex real world models (physical, biological etc.) on massively parallel computer architectures.\n\nUG4 is implemented in the C++ programming language and provides grid management, discretization and (linear as well as non-linear) solver utilities. It is extensible and customizable via its plugin mechanism. The highly scalable MPI based parallelization of UG4 has been shown to scale to hundred thousands of cores.\n\nSimulation workflows are defined either using the Lua scripting language or the graphical VRL interface https://vrl-studio.mihosoft.eu/. Besides that, UG4 can be used as a library for third-party code.\n\nSeveral examples are provided in the Examples application that can be used for simulations of the corresponding phenomena but also serve as demonstration modules for implementing user-defined plugins and scripts. By developing custom plugins, users can extend the functionality of the framework for their particular purposes. The framework provides coupling facilities for the models implemented in different plugins.\n\nKey elements of UG4 are:\n\n* Efficient solvers on distributed, adaptive multigrid hierarchies.\n* A flexible component based discretization system.\n* Efficient support for massively parallel computer architectures.\n* Full scripting support.\n* A modular plugin based architecture.",

TheVirtualBrain is a framework for the simulation of the dynamics of large-scale brain networks with biologically realistic connectivity. TheVirtualBrain uses tractographic data (DTI/DSI) to generate connectivity matrices and build cortical and subcortical brain networks. The connectivity matrix defines the connection strengths and time delays via signal transmission between all network nodes. Various neural mass models are available in the repertoire of TheVirtualBrain and define the dynamics of a network node. Together, the neural mass models at the network nodes and the connectivity matrix define the Virtual Brain. TheVirtualBrain simulates and generates the time courses of various forms of neural activity including Local Field Potentials (LFP) and firing rate, as well as brain imaging data such as EEG, MEG and BOLD activations as observed in fMRI.\n\nTheVirtualBrain is foremost a scientific simulation platform and provides all means necessary to generate, manipulate and visualize connectivity and network dynamics. In addition, TheVirtualBrain comprises a set of classical time series analysis tools, structural and functional connectivity analysis tools, as well as parameter exploration facilities.",

The 3D polygonal meshes that approximate the cell membrane can be generated at different resolution levels, allowing balance to be reached between the complexity and the quality of the final model.\nNeuronize implements a novel approach to generate a realistic 3D shape of the soma from the incomplete information stored in the digitally traced neuron using a physical deformation technique.\nThe addition of a set of spines along the dendrites completes the model, generating a final 3D neuronal cell suitable for its visualization in a wide range of 3D environments.",

A series of steps are defined to achieve this. After image stabilization and transposing an image sequence to the (time x pixel) space, Cross-spectral analysis is applied to low frequency(<1Hz) decimated pixel traces. This results in images representing the cross spectral power of each pixel with it's surrounding pixels at increasing frequency components (0.017Hz steps - 0.4Hz). These images are used to define preliminary ROIs using morphological criteria. The ROIs are then constrained to contain only pixels with possitive correlations. \n \n The pipeline includes a graphical user interface to edit the automatically extracted ROIs, to add new ones or delete ROIs by further constraining their properties.",

Prominent examples include studies on spike-timing dependent plasticity in large simulations of cortical networks, the verification of mean-field models, models of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease and tinnitus. Recent developments include a significant reduction in memory requirements, as demonstrated by a record-breaking simulation of 1.86 billion neurons connected by 11.1 trillion synapses on the Japanese K supercomputer, paving the way for brain-scale simulations.\nRunning on everything from laptops to the world’s largest supercomputers, NEST is configured and controlled by high-level Python scripts, while harnessing the power of C++ under the hood. An extensive testsuite and systematic quality assurance ensure the reliability of NEST.\nThe development of NEST is driven by the demands of neuroscience and carried out in a collaborative fashion at many institutions around the world, coordinated by the non-profit member-based NEST Initiative.",

The need for a definitive resource for comparing performance and correctness of simulation engines on HPC systems.\n2. The need to verify the performance and correctness of individual simulation engines as they change over time.\n3. The need to test that changes to an HPC system do not cause performance or correctness regressions in simulation engines.\n\nThe framework currently supports the simulation engines Arbor, NEURON, and CoreNeuron, while allowing other simulation engines to be added.",
