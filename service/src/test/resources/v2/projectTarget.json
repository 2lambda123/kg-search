      "value": "The Medical Informatics Platform of the Human Brain Project (HBP) is a collaborative platform for privacy aware analysis on real hospital datasets. It federates patient data located in hospitals helping researchers identify patterns unique to diseases to provide clear diagnoses and personalized treatments. \nOne of the distinctive and restrictive characteristics of the MIP is that data is stored on the hospitals’ servers and never leaves the hospital-owner. Therefore, only the metadata for these datasets is publicly available and imported in the HBP database - the Knowledge Graph."
