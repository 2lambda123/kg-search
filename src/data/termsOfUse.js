This text is provided to describe the requirements for citing data found via HBP Knowledge Graph Data Platform (KG): [https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/explore-the-brain/search](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/explore-the-brain/search). It is meant to provide a more human-readable form of key parts of the KG Terms of Service, but in the event of disagreement between the [KG Terms of Service](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/search-terms-of-use/) and these Citation Requirements, the former is to be taken as authoritative.

####Dataset licensing
All datasets in the KG have explicit licensing conditions attached. The license is typically one of the Creative Commons licenses. You must follow the licensing conditions attached to the dataset, including all restrictions on commercial use, requirements for attribution or requirements to share-alike.

####HBP Knowledge Graph citation policy

If you use of the software and datasets found via the KG, the KG Pyxus API or KG REST API in your scientific publication you **must** follow the following citation policy:

1) Cite the Site: "HBP Knowledge Graph Data Platform: <https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/explore-the-brain/search>"

2) For a dataset is released under a Creative Commons license which includes "Attribution", please cite:   
>a) The primary publication listed under the dataset.

>b) The dataset DOI, if using a collection of single datasets.

>c) The parent project DOI, if using multiple dataset from the same project

>d) In cases where a primary publication is not provided, and only in such cases, the names of the Data Contributors should be cited (Data provided by Contributor 1, Contributor 2, ..., and Contributor N) in addition to the citation of the Site and the DOI for the data.

  3) For software, you must cite software as defined in the software's respective citation policy. If you can not find a citation or acknowledgement policy for the software, please use the opensource repository link as the citation link.

Failure to cite data or software used in a publication or presentation constitutes scientific misconduct.   Failure to cite data or software used in a scientific publication must be corrected by issuing an official Erratum and correction of the given article if it is discovered post-publication.

####Final thoughts
Citations of datasets are essential for encouraging researchers to release their data through the KG or other scientific data sharing platforms. Your citation may help them to get their next job or next grant and will ultimately encourage researchers to produce and release more useful open data. Make science more reproducible and more efficient.`;
