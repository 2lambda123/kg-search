# Search UI
The search UI is available at https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/search/ 

It's based on Create React App and is using Search Kit (http://www.searchkit.co) library.

You'll find the code on GitHub at https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/kg-search-ui.

You can then simply start the UI locally with:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

# Backend
The backend for the search UI is an Elasticsearch instance.
You'll find the backend scripts on Gitlab at https://github.com/HumanBrainProject/kg-search
